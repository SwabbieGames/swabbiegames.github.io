    <h1>🐾 9 Trials of Whiskers</h1>

    <h2>📢 Latest Update</h2>
    <pre>The first day of working on achievements is coming to an end!
Most of the time was spent researching how achievements connect to Steam through its API. By the end of the day, I had created achievement icons for each trial (1-9) and successfully tested adding an achievement in Steamworks.

Over the coming week, I'll be creating art for many more achievement types. After that, I'll implement the achievements in-game and test them on Steam. This will also mark the first time the game interacts with the Steam server, allowing me to track stats—like how many times players have died, both individually and across all players.

There will be six hidden achievements in the game... When earned, they will ignite a torch shining onto their corresponding painting in the first hallway.</pre>

    <h2>🛠️ Latest Patch Notes</h2>
    <pre>**Patch 0.1.1 - Individual Trials Ready**
As an option to running all 9 Trials you can now select a specific trial or even the demo version from the main menu!
Want to improve your consistency on trial 8? No problem! 
Think you have the fastest start in the world at trial 1? You can now prove it!

Choices for Trials are:
- 9 Trials of Whiskers (The full game)
- Demo Version (The first 5 trials)
- Any individual trial 1-9

Separate leaderboards and ghosts for each Trial
-Once you selected what trial(s) you want to run, the leaderboards in the menu and the ghosts used will match the trial(s) you chose.</pre>

    <h2>🗺️ Latest Roadmap</h2>
    <pre>**By March 21, 2025:**
- Steam page finalized – Includes screenshots, descriptions, and trailer.
- Achievement & menu art updated – Temporary AI art will be replaced with edited in-game screenshots.
- Submit test build to Steam – First round of testing before demo launch. 

**April 2025:**
🚀 Demo Release, Steam Wishlist & Marketing
- The demo will be released as soon as possible. The earliest possible release date is 14 days after the demo game gets approved.
- Trailers, gameplay videos, and social media content (YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, etc.) will follow to drive wishlists and community growth.
- Consistent short-form content (clips, dev logs, challenges) will be posted to create further growth.

🐞 Post-Demo Updates & Bug Fixes
- If many people play the demo, I expect new bugs and feature requests to emerge.
- I will allocate time to fix and improve the game based on feedback.

🐾 Character Animations
- New animations will be implemented such as the cat jumping, washing itself and sleeping.

🎮 Controller support
- I currently do not have a controller but will purchase one to ensure full support and proper testing.

🖥 System requirements testing
- I will explore virtual machines and performance benchmarks to determine recommended and minimum system requirements for 9 Trials of Whiskers.

🏅 Achievements for Steam
- Built in achievements in the game will be linked with Steam achievements.

**Further Planned Content:**
🏆 God Gamer Challenge & Hall of Fame
- After the full game launch, I will announce a speedrunning challenge.
- Players who beat the game under X seconds and submit video proof (via YouTube, stream, or Speedrun.com) will earn an in-game statue with their name in the Hall of Fame.

🎗 Kickstarter & Hall of Legends
- If I run a Kickstarter or Indiegogo, a reward tier will include an in-game statue with a short personalized message in the Hall of Legends. (The Hall of Legends will be a separate area from the Hall of Fame.)</pre>
