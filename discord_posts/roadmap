**April 2025:**
🚀 Demo Release, Steam Wishlist & Marketing
- The demo will be released as soon as possible. The earliest possible release date is 14 days after the demo game gets approved.
- Trailers, gameplay videos, and social media content (YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, etc.) will follow to drive wishlists and community growth.
- Consistent short-form content (clips, dev logs, challenges) will be posted to create further growth.

🐞 Post-Demo Updates & Bug Fixes
- If many people play the demo, I expect new bugs and feature requests to emerge.
- I will allocate time to fix and improve the game based on feedback.

🐾 Character Animations
- New animations will be implemented such as the cat jumping, washing itself and sleeping.

🎮 Controller support
- I currently do not have a controller but will purchase one to ensure full support and proper testing.

🖥 System requirements testing
- I will explore virtual machines and performance benchmarks to determine recommended and minimum system requirements for 9 Trials of Whiskers.

🏅 Achievements for Steam
- Built in achievements in the game will be linked with Steam achievements.

**Further Planned Content:**
🏆 God Gamer Challenge & Hall of Fame
- After the full game launch, I will announce a speedrunning challenge.
- Players who beat the game under X seconds and submit video proof (via YouTube, stream, or Speedrun.com) will earn an in-game statue with their name in the Hall of Fame.

🎗 Kickstarter & Hall of Legends
- If I run a Kickstarter or Indiegogo, a reward tier will include an in-game statue with a short personalized message in the Hall of Legends. (The Hall of Legends will be a separate area from the Hall of Fame.)
