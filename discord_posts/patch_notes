Minor Patch 0.3.1 - Small balance and bugfixes

Balance:
- Enemies in Trial 2 increased movement speed from 6.1 to 8. This trial was trivialized with the players 20% increased movement speed in patch 0.3. The new change makes this trial more challenging again.

Bugfixes:
- Repositioned the start timer for trial 5 specific runs. It was previously located at the entrance of the room while the player spawned inside the room, allowing the player to skip the timer completely. The timer now starts when the player enters the first platform.
- The end of run display text were incorrectly reading previous best times and deaths, making 'personal best' always being shown for these metrics. This has been fixed and 'personal best' should now only be shown for all time best scores of the current difficulty and trial selected.

UI:
- Certain UI elements lacked auto sizing of text, which could create issues with certain language translations. Auto sizing have now been applied to these.
