**Patch 0.2 and 0.3 - Animations, Languages, Controller Support, Achievements and balance/quality of life/bug fixes.**
**Part 2/2**

🎮 **Partial Controller Support Added**
- Controller hotkeys are now supported (joysticks are always tied to movement).
- Button mapping varies by controller type — players can remap inputs for actions like jumping, menu selection, and camera rotation.
- An optional movement mode is available (press V) that locks camera to player rotation — useful for some controller setups.
- Full controller support will require:
 ○ Xbox / PlayStation controller testing.
 ○ A virtual keyboard setup for saving names to leaderboards with a controller.

🏆 **Achievements Ready for Full Launch**
- 16 unique achievement icons have been created and implemented into the game.
- Achievements have been fully tested on Steam.
- Steam does not allow achievements in demos — they will go live with the full release.

🖼️ AI Art Replaced
- All temporary AI-generated art has been replaced.
- This includes menu backgrounds, achievement icons, and hallway paintings.

🐛 Bug Fixes
- Ramp wall climbing removed:
 ○ Characters could previously wedge into ramp corners and climb walls slowly.
 ○ Wall friction has been reduced — this no longer seems possible.
- Wall clipping when climbing ramps fixed:
 ○ Hugging angled walls while moving up ramps could clip the character into geometry.
 ○ Cause: Walls were separated per floor.
 ○ Fix: An invisible wall object now stretches across floors, preventing clipping.

🚫 **First Person Mode Removed**
- Removed due to conflicts with the new animation system and very low usage.
- Third-person camera now offers Close/Far views (toggle with ‘C’).

🛠️ **Other**
- Full Game Steam store page has been completed.
- Menu navigation now supports back/forward hotkeys, controller input, and custom keybindings.
- Youtube channel is now live with a couple of videos: https://www.youtube.com/@SwabbieGames
